# Expltools: Development tools for expl3 programmers

This repository contains the code and documentation of an expl3 static analysis tool `explcheck` outlined in the following devlog posts:

1. [Introduction][1]
2. [Requirements][2]
3. [Related work][3]
4. [Design][4]

On September 6, 2024, the tool has been [accepted for funding][5] by [the TeX Development Fund][6].
The full text of the project proposal, which summarizes devlog posts 1â€“4 is available [here][7].

In the future, this repository may also contain the code of other useful development tools for expl3 programmers, such as a command-line utility similar to `grep` that will ignore whitespaces and newlines as well as other tools.
