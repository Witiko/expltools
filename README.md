# Expltools: Development tools for expl3 programmers

This repository will contain the documentation and the code for an expl3 static analysis tool (a *linter*) outlined in the following devlog posts:

- [Static analysis of expl3 programs (1): Introduction][1]
- [Static analysis of expl3 programs (2): Requirements][2]
- [Static analysis of expl3 programs (3): Related work][3]
- Static analysis of expl3 programs (4): Design *(to appear)*

In the future, this repository may also contain the code of other useful development tools for expl3 programmers, such as a command-line utility similar to `grep` that will ignore whitespaces and newlines, and other tools.
