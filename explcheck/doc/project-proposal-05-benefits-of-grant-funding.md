# Benefits of grant funding

Securing this grant will significantly enhance my ability to dedicate focused and uninterrupted time to this project, enabling me to allocate at least two full weeks of work over the next 12 months. This concentrated effort will be far more productive than the fragmented hours I currently manage to find after a long day's work, ensuring that I can make substantial progress.

Additionally, the grant will serve as a meaningful endorsement of the project's value, reflecting the community's interest and support. This recognition will not only reinforce the importance of the work but also help attract other contributors who share a commitment to advancing the project.

Finally, the visibility that comes with receiving this grant will elevate the project's profile, making it more prominent within the TeX community and beyond. This increased visibility is crucial for attracting further interest, feedback, and potential collaborations, all of which are vital for the project's long-term success.
